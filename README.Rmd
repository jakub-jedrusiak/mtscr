An R adaptation of Multidimentional Top Scoring method presented by Forthmann, Karwowski and Beaty ([2023](https://doi.org/10.1037/aca0000571)) adapted from public code in the [OSF database](https://osf.io/7rgsp/). The code was adapted to use the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) framework for greater flexibility.

## Installation {#installation}

You can install the development version of mtscr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jakub-jedrusiak/mtscr")
```

The mtscr package is not on CRAN yet.

## Usage {#usage}

Basic usage involves scoring participants' responses to a divergent thinking task. The package includes a sample dataset `mtscr_creativity` with 4652 responses to the [Alternative Uses Task](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_uses_test) with semantic distance scored. The dataset comes from the original paper (Forthmann, Karwowski and Beaty, [2023](https://doi.org/10.1037/aca0000571)).

The main function is `mtscr_scores()` which can return a df with scores for each participant, each item or each participant-item combination. Scores come from two models -- `all_max` and `all_top2`. A value for a participant is the maximum value predicted by the model for that participant.

```{r}
library("mtscr")
data("mtscr_creativity", package = "mtscr")

mtscr_score(mtscr_creativity, id, item, SemDis_MEAN)
```

`mtscr_score()` does everything automatically. You can also use `mtscr_prepare()` to get your data prepared for modelling by hand and `mtscr_model()` to get the model object. See the functions' documentation for more details.

### Graphical User Interface {#graphical-user-interface}

This package includes a Shiny app which can be used as a GUI. You can find "mtscr GUI" option in RStudio's Addins menu. Alternatively execute `mtscr_app()` to run it.

![](./man/figures/README-GUI-example.gif)

> Try web based version [here](https://jakub-jedrusiak.shinyapps.io/mtscr_GUI/)!

First thing you see after running the app is [`datamods`](https://github.com/dreamRs/datamods) window for importing your data. You can use the data already loaded in your environment or any other option. Then you'll see four dropdown lists used to choose arguments for `mtscr_model()` and `mtscr_score()` functions. Consult these functions' documentation for more details (execute `?mtscr_score` in the console). When the parameters are chosen, click "Generate model" button. After a while (up to a dozen or so seconds) models' parameters and are shown along with a scored dataframe.

You can download your data as a .csv or an .xlsx file using buttons in the sidebar. You can either download the scores only (i.e. the dataframe you see displayed) or your whole data with `.all_max` and `.all_top2` columns added.

For testing purposes, you may use `mtscr_creativity` dataframe. In the importing window change "Global Environment" to "mtscr" and our dataframe should appear in the upper dropdown list. Use `id` for the ID column, `item` for the item column and `SemDis_MEAN` for the score column.

Correspondence concerning the meritorical side of these solutions should be addressed to Boris Forthmann, Institute of Psychology, University of Münster, Fliednerstrasse 21, 48149 Münster, Germany. Email: [boris.forthmann\@wwu.de](mailto:boris.forthmann@wwu.de){.email}.

The maintainer of the R package is Jakub Jędrusiak and the technical concerns should be directed to him. Well, me. Best way is to open a [discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/jakub-jedrusiak/mtscr/discussions). Technical difficulties may deserve an [issue](https://github.com/jakub-jedrusiak/mtscr/issues).
